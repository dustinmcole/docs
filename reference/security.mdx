# Security & Privacy

Security isn't an add-on tier — it's the architecture. Every Joan deployment has mandatory security built in.

## The Six Principles

### 1. Joan only talks to people you authorize
Every user is individually allowlisted. Random people can't interact with Joan. If someone not on the list sends her a message, she ignores it.

### 2. Joan can only see what you give her access to
Each integration is scoped to specific data. Joan's Salesforce connection might only see donor records, not HR data. Her ClickUp access might be limited to specific spaces. You define the boundaries.

### 3. Joan proposes, she doesn't act
Draft emails get reviewed before sending. Task creation gets confirmed. Data modifications require approval. Joan never sends, creates, or deletes without human sign-off.

See [Approvals & Human-in-the-Loop](../guides/approvals.md) for details.

### 4. Your data never leaves your instance
Each client gets a **completely isolated environment**. No shared infrastructure, no shared databases. Even search indexing runs locally on your dedicated machine.

### 5. Everything is auditable
Every action Joan takes is logged:

- Every conversation recorded
- Every API call tracked
- Every configuration change version-controlled
- Every approval and rejection documented

Ask Joan for her activity log anytime, or request a full audit report from Datawake.

### 6. You can shut it off instantly
One command stops Joan completely. Your data stays intact. No lock-in, no data held hostage. If you leave, we hand over your entire configuration — standard files, no proprietary formats.

## Infrastructure Security

### Dedicated Hardware
Joan runs on her own dedicated Mac — not shared cloud infrastructure. Your data, files, and systems are isolated to that single machine.

### Encryption
- **Data at rest** — Enterprise-grade encryption on all storage
- **Data in transit** — TLS encryption on all API communications
- **Backups** — Automated encrypted backups

### Access Control
- **Per-user authorization** — Each team member is individually configured
- **Per-integration scoping** — Each tool connection has defined boundaries
- **Role-based permissions** — Different users can have different approval levels

### Monitoring
- **Health monitoring** — Joan's infrastructure is monitored 24/7
- **Security patches** — Applied promptly as they become available
- **Alerting** — Datawake is notified of any anomalies

## SOC 2 Alignment

Joan's security practices align with SOC 2 standards:

- Access control and authentication
- Data encryption and protection
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Change management and version control
- Incident response procedures

## Data Handling

### What Joan stores
- Conversation history (for context and memory)
- Learned preferences and corrections
- Scheduled job configurations
- Integration credentials (encrypted)
- Cached data from connected tools

### What Joan doesn't store
- Raw data from your tools beyond what's needed for active tasks
- Conversation data from other clients (isolation is absolute)
- Credentials in plain text

### Data retention
Conversation history and logs are retained for the duration of your service. Upon termination, all data can be exported or securely deleted per your preference.

## Compliance Considerations

If your organization has specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, FERPA, PCI, etc.), discuss them during your discovery session. Joan's architecture supports additional security measures:

- Enhanced audit logging
- Data handling restrictions
- Access review schedules
- Custom retention policies

## Reporting a Security Concern

If you notice anything unusual with Joan's behavior or suspect a security issue, contact Datawake immediately at [dustin@datawake.io](mailto:dustin@datawake.io).
