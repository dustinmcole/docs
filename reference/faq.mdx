## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I start using Joan?">
    Just send her a message in Slack (or your configured channel). Joan is already set up and ready — no installation or configuration on your end. Say hello and ask her something.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to learn special commands?">
    No. Talk to Joan in natural language, like you'd talk to a colleague. "What's on my calendar today?" and "Can you create a task for Sarah?" work perfectly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know which channel to use?">
    Use the channel that matches the topic. Finance questions in `#finance`, operations questions in `#operations`, etc. Joan tailors her context and responses to the channel. For anything general, DM her directly.

## AI Models

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What AI model does Joan use?">
    Joan uses different models for different tasks. Simple lookups use a fast model (Haiku), everyday work uses a balanced model (Sonnet), and complex tasks use the most capable model (Opus). See [Switching Models](/guides/switching-models) for details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I choose which model Joan uses?">
    Yes — you can request a specific model for any task. You can also ask Datawake to permanently assign a model to specific workflows. See [Switching Models](/guides/switching-models).

## Privacy & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who can see my conversations with Joan?">
    Only you and authorized Datawake administrators (for support purposes). Joan's infrastructure is completely isolated — no other clients can see your data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can Joan access all my data in connected tools?">
    No. Each integration is scoped to specific data. Joan only sees what her credentials allow. You define the boundaries during onboarding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where is my data stored?">
    On Joan's dedicated machine — not in shared cloud infrastructure. Your data never leaves your isolated instance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my data if I cancel?">
    Your configuration is standard files. We hand over everything or securely delete it — your choice. No lock-in, no data held hostage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause a scheduled job?">
    Yes — just tell Joan. "Pause the weekly report until January" or "Skip tomorrow's briefing." She'll confirm and resume automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I add a new scheduled job?">
    Describe what you need to Datawake. New jobs are typically built and deployed within a few days using your support hours.
