# Tools & Integrations

Bryn connects to virtually any tool with an API — plus browser automation for tools without APIs.

## Connected Tools

Bryn can integrate with any of the following. Your specific connections are configured during onboarding.

### Communication

### Browser Automation
For tools without APIs, Bryn uses a web browser on her dedicated machine:

- Web research and data gathering
- Form fills and submissions
- Data lookups on web platforms
- Screenshot capture for verification
- Any task you'd normally do in a browser

## How Integrations Work

Each integration is:

1. **Scoped** — Bryn only accesses the data you authorize. She can't see everything in your Salesforce — only what her integration credentials allow.
2. **Read-first** — Most integrations default to read-only. Write access (creating tasks, sending emails) requires explicit configuration.
3. **Authenticated** — Each connection uses secure API credentials managed by Datawake. No credentials are shared between clients.
4. **Monitored** — Every API call is logged for audit purposes.

## Requesting New Integrations

If Bryn doesn't currently connect to a tool you use:

1. **Check if it has an API** — Most modern tools do. Bryn can connect to any tool with a REST API.
2. **No API?** — Bryn can use browser automation as a fallback.
3. **Contact Datawake** — New integrations are typically set up within a few days using your support hours.

<Tip>
**Common integration requests:** "Can Bryn connect to [tool]?" — The answer is almost always yes. If it has an API or a web interface, Bryn can work with it.
</Tip>

## Integration Limits

- **Rate limits** — Some APIs have request limits. Bryn is configured to stay well within them.
- **Data freshness** — Bryn queries tools in real-time for most requests. Scheduled reports may use cached data.
- **Permissions** — Bryn can only do what the API credentials allow. She can't bypass your tool's permission model.
