Bryn is ready to talk. Here's how to get started and what to expect.

## Say Hello

Open Slack (or your configured messaging tool) and find Bryn's channel or send her a direct message. Start with something simple:

<Note>
**Try these:**
- "Hey Bryn, what's on my calendar today?"
- "What tasks are due this week?"
- "Can you draft an email to Sarah about the project update?"
- "Give me a summary of our Q4 expenses."
</Note>

Bryn will respond in seconds. She already knows your tools, your calendar, and your task lists — no setup required on your end.

## What to Expect

**Bryn responds in natural language.** No special commands, no syntax to memorize. Talk to her like you'd talk to a colleague.

**She'll ask for clarification if needed.** If your request is ambiguous, Bryn will ask a follow-up question rather than guess wrong.

**She proposes before she acts.** For actions like sending emails, creating tasks, or modifying data, Bryn will show you what she plans to do and wait for your approval.

<Tip>
**Approval flow example:**

Bryn: *"I'll create a task in ClickUp for Sarah: 'Review Q4 donor report' — due Friday, high priority. Want me to go ahead?"*

You: *"Yes"* or *"Make it medium priority"* or *"Hold off on that"*
</Tip>

## Things Bryn Is Great At

Try asking Bryn to:

- **Pull data** — "What were our top 5 expenses last month?"
- **Draft communications** — "Write a thank-you email to the board for last night's event"
- **Manage tasks** — "Create a task for the team to review the new policy by next Wednesday"
- **Prepare for meetings** — "What do I need for my 2pm meeting?"
- **Track budgets** — "How many hours have we used on the MTS project this month?"

## Things Bryn Will Learn

Bryn starts strong, but she gets better as she learns your style:

- How you like emails formatted
- Which tasks are high priority vs. routine
- Your team's naming conventions
- Who handles what on your team
- Your preferred level of detail in reports

**Just use her.** The more you interact, the sharper she gets.
