Joan lives where your team already works. No new apps to install, no new interfaces to learn.

## Supported Channels

    - Dedicated channels for specific workflows
    - Thread replies for context-rich conversations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Microsoft Teams">
    Joan integrates with Teams for organizations that use it as their primary platform. Same conversational interface, same capabilities.

    - Chat directly with Joan
    - Add Joan to team channels
    - @mention Joan in conversations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iMessage">

    - Best for quick questions or approvals
    - "Hey Joan, approve that task" or "What's my first meeting tomorrow?"

## Channel-Based Workflows

This is where Joan gets powerful. **Use Slack channels to compartmentalize your processes**, and Joan will tailor her behavior to each one.

**Real-world examples:**

**#finance** — Joan posts overdue invoice alerts, you ask her to categorize receipts in QuickBooks, she delivers monthly expense summaries.

**#operations** — Morning briefings land here. Joan tracks tasks, flags overdue items, and posts daily status updates.

**#development** — Joan monitors project timelines, posts sprint summaries, and flags blockers.

**#board-prep** — When board meetings approach, Joan assembles agendas, pulls financials, and compiles program updates — all posted here for review.

**#donors** — Lapsed donor alerts, stewardship reminders, and draft thank-you letters — all in one place.

Each channel gets its own context. Joan knows that a message in `#finance` is about money and a message in `#operations` is about tasks. She responds accordingly.

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of Joan

### Be natural
Talk to Joan like a person. "Can you check if we're over budget on the Acme project?" works perfectly. No special syntax needed.

### Be specific when it matters
Joan handles ambiguity well, but specifics get better results:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Send an email" | "Draft an email to Sarah about the Q4 report" |
| "Make a task" | "Create a high-priority task for Mike to review the contract by Friday" |
| "What's our budget?" | "What's our remaining budget on the EFMN project for this month?" |

### Correct her in the moment
If Joan gets something wrong, tell her right there:

> *"That's not how we format donor reports — we use bullet points, not paragraphs."*

She'll remember for next time. Corrections are permanent.

### Use threads for multi-step conversations
If you're working through something complex (drafting a proposal, planning an event, debugging a process), use a Slack thread. Joan keeps the full context within a thread.

### Let her propose
Joan will often suggest next steps. Let her. She might catch things you'd forget:

> *"I noticed you have a meeting with the board on Thursday but the financials doc hasn't been updated since last month. Want me to refresh it?"*

## Availability

Joan runs **24/7**. She doesn't have office hours. Send a message at 11pm and she'll respond immediately. Schedule something for 5am and she'll handle it while you sleep.

The only exception is during planned maintenance windows, which are rare and always communicated in advance.
