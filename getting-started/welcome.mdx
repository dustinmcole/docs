description: What Bryn is, what she can do, and how she fits into your day.

Bryn is your dedicated AI assistant — built, trained, and managed by Datawake specifically for your organization. She's not a generic chatbot. She knows your tools, your processes, your team's preferences, and she gets better every week.

## What Makes Bryn Different

Most AI tools wait for you to type something. Bryn doesn't.

Bryn runs **24/7** on dedicated infrastructure, proactively handling tasks, monitoring for problems, and keeping your operations running smoothly — without you having to ask.

<Tip>
**Think of Bryn as a team member, not a tool.** She has persistent memory, learns your preferences over time, and can be corrected like a colleague. Tell her "we don't do it that way" once, and she'll remember permanently.

## What Bryn Can Do

Here's a quick overview — see [What Bryn Can Do](/guides/capabilities) for the full list.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Daily Operations** | Morning briefings, task creation, calendar prep |
| **Communication** | Email drafting, meeting follow-ups, team check-ins |
| **Reporting** | Weekly reports, budget tracking, data queries |
| **Monitoring** | Budget alerts, overdue task flags, missed follow-ups |

## How Bryn Learns

Bryn improves through everyday use:

- **Month 1** — Handles briefings, basic tasks, hours tracking. Getting to know you.
- **Month 3** — Knows your team's working styles, anticipates needs, drafts are 90% right on first try.
- **Month 6** — Effectively a veteran team member. Handles routine operations independently, only escalates edge cases.

Every correction you make sticks. Every preference she picks up accumulates. She doesn't forget and she doesn't need to be retrained.
