description: Morning briefings, task management, reports, email drafting, and more.
---

Bryn handles the operational work that eats your day — so you can focus on the work that matters.

## Daily Operations

### Morning Briefings
Every morning, Bryn delivers a briefing to your Slack channel:

- Today's calendar with meeting prep notes
- Priority tasks and deadlines
- Unread items that need attention
- Any alerts or flags from overnight monitoring

### Task Management
Create, assign, and track tasks in natural language:

> *"Create a task for Sarah to review the proposal by Friday, high priority."*

Bryn puts it in the right list, with the right assignee, right priority — no clicking through menus.

### Calendar Management
Bryn monitors your calendar and proactively helps:

- Conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- Meeting prep materials assembled in advance
- Schedule coordination across team members

## Communication

### Email Drafting
Bryn writes emails in your voice, using context from recent work:

> *"Draft a follow-up email to the team about yesterday's strategy meeting."*

She'll pull action items from meeting notes, reference relevant documents, and match your writing style. Review, edit if needed, and send.

### Meeting Follow-Up
Within 30 minutes of a meeting ending, Bryn:

1. Reads the meeting notes
2. Extracts action items
3. Proposes tasks with owners and priorities
4. Creates tasks once you approve

### Team Check-Ins
Bryn checks in with team members at scheduled times (e.g., 4pm daily), collects their updates, and posts a summary to your leadership channel.

## Reporting & Data

### Automated Reports
Weekly, monthly, quarterly — Bryn pulls data from your systems, formats the report, and delivers it. No one has to write them.

- Weekly status updates
- Monthly financial summaries
- Quarterly board reports
- Pipeline reviews

### Data Queries
Ask questions about your data in plain English:

> *"What are our top 5 donors by lifetime giving?"*
>
> *"How many hours did we bill last month?"*
>
> *"Which campaigns had the highest ROI last quarter?"*

Bryn queries your connected systems and returns the answer in Slack.

### Hours & Budget Tracking
- Daily hour estimates posted to your finance channel
- Monthly billing summaries
- Budget alerts when projects approach their caps
- Automatic hours logging from calendar and task activity

## Monitoring & Alerts

Bryn watches for problems so you don't have to:

- **Budget thresholds** — alerts when spending approaches limits
- **Overdue tasks** — flags items past their due date
- **Missed follow-ups** — reminds you of commitments you made
- **Expiring contracts** — advance notice on renewals
- **Declining metrics** — flags negative trends in your data

<Tip>
**Proactive, not reactive.** Bryn doesn't wait for you to ask "are we over budget?" — she tells you *before* you hit the limit.
</Tip>

## Document Management

### Knowledge Base Maintenance
Bryn audits your documentation, identifies outdated content, flags duplicates, and proposes updates or deletions.

### Auto-Documentation
When processes change, Bryn updates the relevant docs automatically. No more stale SOPs.

## Smart Reminders

Bryn tracks commitments across conversations and nudges you when things slip:

> *"You mentioned you'd review the grant proposal by Wednesday — it's Thursday and it's still in your queue."*

## Browser Automation

Because Bryn runs on dedicated hardware, she can use a web browser for tasks that don't have API integrations:

- Web research
- Form fills
- Data lookups
- Any browser-based workflow
