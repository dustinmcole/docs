title: Training Joan
description: How Joan learns from your corrections, preferences, and everyday use.
---

Joan learns from every interaction. You don't need to fill out forms or write training documents — just work with her normally, and she gets better.

## How Learning Works

### Conversational Corrections
The simplest way to train Joan: tell her when she's wrong.

> *"We don't format reports that way — use bullet points, not paragraphs."*
>
> *"When I say 'the board,' I mean the board of directors, not the project board."*
>
> *"Sarah handles donor communications, not Mike."*

Joan remembers these corrections **permanently**. She won't make the same mistake twice.

### Preference Accumulation
Over time, Joan picks up on patterns:

- How you like emails structured
- Your preferred level of formality
- Which team members handle which responsibilities
- Your naming conventions for tasks and projects
- Your preferred report formats

You don't need to explicitly teach these — she absorbs them from your conversations and corrections.

### Knowledge Updates
As your organization evolves — new projects, new team members, new processes — Joan learns through everyday use:

- Mention a new team member in conversation, and Joan will start including them in relevant workflows
- Change a process, and Joan adapts when you correct her or describe the new way
- New data sources are connected by Datawake, and Joan immediately starts querying them

## Tips for Effective Training

### Be specific with corrections
Instead of "that's wrong," tell Joan *what's* wrong and *what's right*:

| Less effective | More effective |
|---------------|----------------|
| "That email is wrong" | "Use a more formal tone for board members" |
| "Fix the report" | "Add a budget summary section at the top" |
| "Wrong person" | "Route finance questions to Sarah, not Mike" |

### Reinforce good behavior
When Joan gets something right — especially something she previously got wrong — a quick confirmation helps:

> *"Perfect, that's exactly the format I want."*

### Let Datawake handle complex training
Some things are easier to configure than to teach through conversation:

- New tool integrations
- Complex workflow logic
- Multi-step automations
- Custom report templates

For these, describe what you need and Datawake will build it during your support hours.

## What Joan Remembers

Joan has **persistent memory** — she doesn't start fresh each conversation. Her memory includes:

- **Corrections** — Every correction you've made
- **Preferences** — Communication style, formatting, priorities
- **Organizational knowledge** — Team structure, project names, tool configurations
- **Conversation history** — Past interactions for context (within privacy boundaries)
- **Workflow patterns** — How you typically handle recurring tasks

## What Joan Doesn't Learn Automatically

Some things require Datawake to configure:

- New tool connections (APIs, integrations)
- New scheduled jobs
- Changes to approval workflows
- Security and access changes
- New user onboarding

These are handled through your monthly support hours.

## Requesting New Capabilities

Want Joan to do something she doesn't do yet? Two paths:

1. **Simple additions** — Describe it to Joan and she may be able to do it immediately with her existing tools
2. **New capabilities** — Contact Datawake. Most new capabilities are deployed in **days, not months**.

New capabilities are built and tested by Datawake, then deployed to your instance. No disruption to existing workflows.
