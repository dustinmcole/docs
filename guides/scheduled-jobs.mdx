title: Scheduled Jobs & Automation
description: Bryn works while you sleep — automated reports, reminders, and monitoring.

This is what makes Bryn fundamentally different from other AI tools. She doesn't wait for commands — she runs automated jobs on schedules you define.

## How Scheduled Jobs Work

Bryn has a built-in scheduler that triggers tasks at specific times. These jobs run automatically — no human input needed to start them. Bryn handles the work and delivers the results to your configured channel.

<Tip>
**Always-on operations.** Bryn runs 24/7 on dedicated hardware. Scheduled jobs fire whether you're at your desk, asleep, or on vacation.

## Common Scheduled Jobs

### Morning Briefing
**Schedule:** Every weekday, delivered before your day starts

Bryn compiles:

- Today's calendar with meeting context
- Priority tasks and approaching deadlines
- Overnight alerts or flags
- Action items from yesterday that are still open

Delivered to your Slack channel so it's the first thing you see.

### Weekly Status Reports
**Schedule:** End of week (configurable)

Bryn pulls data from your project management tool, hours tracking, and email, then formats a status report covering:

- Work completed this week
- Hours billed by project
- Upcoming deadlines
- Blockers or risks

### Monthly Financial Summary
**Schedule:** 1st of each month

Bryn queries your financial systems and delivers:

- Total hours billed per client/project
- Budget utilization rates
- Expense summaries
- Revenue tracking against goals

### Daily Hours Log
**Schedule:** End of business (configurable)

Bryn estimates your team's billable hours based on calendar events, task activity, and Slack conversations. Posts a summary to your finance channel.

### Meeting Prep
**Schedule:** Before each meeting (automatic)

Bryn detects upcoming meetings on your calendar and proactively:

- Links relevant documents
- Pulls the latest data
- Lists open action items from previous meetings
- Posts a prep summary to the relevant channel

### Document Review
**Schedule:** Nightly or weekly (configurable)

Bryn scans your knowledge base for:

- Outdated documentation
- Broken links
- Documents that haven't been updated in a configurable period
- Gaps in documentation coverage

### Team Check-Ins
**Schedule:** Afternoon (configurable)

Bryn reaches out to each team member, collects their status update, and compiles a summary for leadership.

## Custom Scheduled Jobs

Any repeating task can be automated. Common examples:

| Job | Schedule | What It Does |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| Invoice follow-up | Weekly | Checks for overdue invoices, sends reminders |
| Donor stewardship | Monthly | Flags donors due for touchpoints |
| Contract monitoring | Daily | Alerts on approaching expiration dates |
| Data backups | Nightly | Verifies backup completion, reports failures |
| Social media | Daily | Drafts posts for review based on your content calendar |
| Pipeline review | Weekly | Summarizes sales/admissions pipeline changes |
| Budget alerts | Daily | Checks spend against thresholds |

## Requesting New Scheduled Jobs

To add a new scheduled job, describe what you need to Datawake:

1. **What** — The task to automate
2. **When** — Schedule (daily, weekly, specific day/time)
3. **Where** — Which Slack channel to deliver results
4. **How** — Any specific formatting or data requirements

New jobs are typically built and deployed within a few days using your monthly support hours.

## Monitoring Your Jobs

Bryn logs every scheduled job execution. If a job fails (API timeout, data unavailable, etc.), she'll alert you and retry.

You can ask Bryn about her schedule anytime:

> *"What jobs do you have running this week?"*
>
> *"When is the next monthly report due?"*
>
> *"Did the nightly backup check run?"*

## Pausing and Resuming Jobs

Need to pause a scheduled job temporarily? Just ask:

> *"Pause the daily hours log until next Monday."*
>
> *"Skip this week's status report."*

Bryn will confirm the pause and resume automatically at the specified time, or you can ask her to resume manually.
