title: Switching Models
description: Which AI model is best for which task, and how to request a change.
---

Joan uses different AI models behind the scenes, each optimized for different types of work. Understanding which model does what helps you get the best results — and manage costs.

## Available Models

Joan has access to three model tiers. Datawake selects the best default for each task, but you can request changes.

### Opus — Highest Quality

The most capable model. Deep reasoning, nuanced writing, and complex multi-step tasks.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Best for** | Strategic analysis, complex writing, multi-step research, sensitive communications, nuanced decision-making |
| **Speed** | Slower — takes more time to think through complex tasks |
| **Cost** | Highest per-message cost |
| **When Joan uses it** | Board communications, grant applications, executive summaries, complex data analysis, ambiguous requests that need careful interpretation |

<Info>
**Opus shines when...**
- You need a grant application draft that weaves together program data, outcomes metrics, and a compelling narrative
- A donor communication requires sensitivity and precise tone-matching
- You ask Joan to analyze a complex budget scenario with multiple dependencies
- The task requires reading multiple documents and synthesizing findings
</Info>

### Sonnet — Balanced

The everyday workhorse. Fast, capable, and cost-effective for most tasks.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Best for** | Daily tasks, email drafts, report generation, task management, data queries, meeting follow-ups |
| **Speed** | Fast — responds in seconds for most tasks |
| **Cost** | Moderate — good balance of quality and cost |
| **When Joan uses it** | Morning briefings, email drafts, task creation, standard reports, data lookups, most day-to-day operations |

<Info>
**Sonnet handles...**
- "Draft a follow-up email to the team about yesterday's meeting"
- "What are our top expenses this month?"
- "Create a task for Sarah to review the proposal by Friday"
- Weekly status reports, meeting summaries, routine communications
</Info>

### Haiku — Fastest

The speed champion. Near-instant responses for simple, straightforward tasks.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Best for** | Quick lookups, simple questions, data retrieval, yes/no decisions, classification, routing |
| **Speed** | Near-instant — responses in under a second |
| **Cost** | Lowest per-message cost |
| **When Joan uses it** | Calendar checks, simple data queries, task status lookups, message classification, quick confirmations |

<Info>
**Haiku is ideal for...**
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "Is the Q4 report done?"
- "What's Sarah's email address?"
- Quick approvals, simple lookups, status checks
</Info>

## How Joan Chooses a Model

Joan automatically selects the right model based on the task.

**The general logic:**

1. **Quick factual lookups** → Haiku (fast, cheap)
2. **Most daily work** → Sonnet (reliable, fast enough)
3. **Complex or sensitive tasks** → Opus (thorough, nuanced)
4. **Scheduled automations** → Model varies by job complexity

You don't need to think about this most of the time — Joan makes good choices by default.

## Requesting a Model Change

If you want Joan to use a specific model for a task, you have two options:

### Per-Request Override

Tell Joan directly:

> *"Use the deep thinking model to analyze this budget variance report."*
>
> *"Give me a quick answer — what time is my meeting tomorrow?"*

Joan will understand the intent and select accordingly.

### Permanent Workflow Override

If a specific workflow should always use a particular model — for example, you want all board communications drafted with Opus — contact Datawake and we'll configure it.

This is done through your support hours and takes effect immediately.

## Cost Implications

Different models have different costs, which are all included in your monthly plan. However, heavy use of Opus for tasks that Sonnet handles well can increase operating costs over time.

| Model | Relative Cost | Typical Use % |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Haiku | $ | ~30% of tasks |
| Sonnet | $$ | ~55% of tasks |
| Opus | $$$$ | ~15% of tasks |

<Tip>
**Cost-effective habits:** You don't need to micro-manage this. Joan is configured to use the most cost-effective model for each task. If overall costs trend up, Datawake will review the model allocation and optimize.
</Tip>

## When to Request Opus

Ask for the deeper model when:

- **The stakes are high** — Board communications, grant applications, donor asks
- **The task is ambiguous** — "Help me figure out why our retention rate dropped"
- **You need synthesis** — Pulling insights from multiple sources or documents
- **Tone matters** — Sensitive HR communications, diplomatic messaging
- **Analysis is complex** — Multi-variable budget scenarios, strategic planning

## When Haiku Is Enough

Don't overthink it — these are just quick lookups:

- Calendar and schedule questions
- Task status checks
- Simple data retrieval ("What's our balance?")
- Yes/no questions
- Routing and classification (Joan uses this internally)

## Model Updates

Datawake periodically updates Joan's models as newer versions become available. These updates are tested before deployment and you'll be notified of any changes.

Model updates are seamless — Joan's personality, memory, and learned preferences carry over between model versions.
