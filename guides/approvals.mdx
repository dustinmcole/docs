title: Approvals & Human-in-the-Loop
description: Joan proposes, you approve. Here's how the approval flow works.
---

Joan is powerful, but she's not autonomous. By default, she **proposes actions and waits for your approval** before executing anything that creates, modifies, or sends data.

## How Approvals Work

When Joan wants to take an action, she'll present it clearly and wait:

<Info>
**Approval flow example:**

**Joan:** I'll create a ClickUp task:
- **Title:** Review Q4 donor report
- **Assignee:** Sarah
- **Due:** Friday
- **Priority:** High
- **List:** EFMN — Active Tasks

Want me to go ahead?

**You:** Yes *(or "Make it medium priority" or "Hold off")*
</Info>

Joan accepts:

- **"Yes"**, **"Go ahead"**, **"Do it"** — executes as proposed
- **Modifications** — "Yes, but make it due next Monday" — adjusts and executes
- **"No"**, **"Hold off"**, **"Cancel"** — does nothing
- **Numbered selections** — when Joan proposes multiple items, reply with numbers: "1, 3, 5"

## What Requires Approval

| Action | Requires Approval? |
|--------|-------------------|
| Sending emails | Yes — always |
| Creating tasks | Yes |
| Modifying existing data | Yes |
| Posting to external channels | Yes |
| Reading/querying data | No — read-only is safe |
| Generating reports | No — just information |
| Drafting (not sending) | No — draft only |
| Scheduled job output | Depends on configuration |

## Batch Approvals

When Joan proposes multiple items (like action items from a meeting), you can approve selectively:

<Info>
**Batch approval example:**

**Joan:** From today's strategy meeting, I extracted these action items:

1. Create task: "Update donor database" — Sarah, due Wednesday
2. Create task: "Review grant timeline" — Mike, due Friday
3. Draft email to board about program changes
4. Schedule follow-up meeting for next Tuesday

Which ones should I proceed with?

**You:** 1, 2, and 4. Hold on 3 — I'll write that one myself.
</Info>

## Adjusting Approval Levels

As you build trust with Joan, you can loosen the approval requirements for specific actions:

- **Tight (default):** Everything proposed, nothing automatic
- **Standard:** Read-only and low-risk actions automatic; creates/sends require approval
- **Trusted:** Routine operations automatic (task creation, report delivery); sensitive actions still require approval

To change your approval level, contact Datawake. Changes are configured per-user and per-action type.

<Warning>
**Sensitive actions always require approval.** Regardless of your trust level, some actions always require human sign-off: sending external emails, modifying financial data, deleting anything, and sharing data externally.
</Warning>

## Approval Timeouts

If Joan proposes an action and you don't respond:

- **No timeout by default** — Joan waits indefinitely
- **Scheduled jobs** — If a job requires approval and doesn't get it, Joan logs the skip and moves on
- **Time-sensitive items** — Joan will remind you if an approval has been pending and a deadline is approaching

## Auditing

Every approval (and rejection) is logged. You can ask Joan for a history:

> *"What actions did you take this week?"*
>
> *"Show me pending approvals."*
>
> *"What did I reject last month?"*

All actions are auditable and version-controlled by Datawake.
